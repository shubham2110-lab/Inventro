Steps to run the project with Daphne, static files, and WebSocket support
=======================================================================

1. Install dependencies inside your virtual environment:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Apply database migrations (only needed the first time or after model changes):
   python manage.py migrate

3. Collect static files so WhiteNoise/Daphne can serve them:
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

4. Launch the ASGI server with Daphne:
   python -m daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 inventro.asgi:application
   (use 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0 if you only want local access)

5. Open the site in your browser at:
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Notes:
 - During active development you can still run: python manage.py runserver
   (Channels swaps in Daphne automatically and static files are served without collectstatic).
 - Re-run collectstatic whenever you change static assets and plan to serve them through Daphne/WhiteNoise.
